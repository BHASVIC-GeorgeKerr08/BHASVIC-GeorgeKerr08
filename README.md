## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  - ðŸŽ¯ My professional goals: I have always had a strong interest in computer science and programming, so my main goal is to be working as a software or game developer, collaborating on projects with a team. There are some other sectors I am interested in, like tech support, however my final career goal is definitely a developer.

  - ðŸŽ“ My qualifications: GCSE Computer Science (Grade 9), 

  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web-based incremental game, inspired by cookie cliker but with a space theme. It's called Idle Planet, and it allows the player tp click a planet, to increase its population, which generates them idle money every second. This money can be used ot purchase upgrades, which give the player different multipliers (for example, double money). The player can play different minigames, which earn them an additional currency, which can be used to purchase more powerful effects. Once reaching a certain population on their planet, the player can travel to a different planet in the galaxy and colonise that, and they can prestige at a certain level which is where they reset all their progress and restart with a multiplier that makes progressing easier than before.
  
  - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning tailwind CSS, which is a CSS framework that makes webpage styling so much easier, allowing me to create an aesthetic, sci-fi visual design for the game. I am watching various youtube tutorials and familiarising myself with the documentation, so I am more confident at using it.
